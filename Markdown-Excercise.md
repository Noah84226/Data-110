## Some of my Hobbies 

Drawing 
I took an art class at Montgomery College and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
I enjoy watching and playing soccer, and I am a Manchester United fan 
## Benefits of playing soccer 
Soccer, through its continual movement, sprinting, and coordination improves general stamina and flexibility, strengthens muscles, and helps with cardiovascular fitness.
